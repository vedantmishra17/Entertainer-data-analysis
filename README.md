# Entertainer Data Analysis

Welcome to the Entertainer Data Analysis project! In this internship project, I embarked on a journey to analyze entertainment data, enriching a partially complete dataset with external information for a more comprehensive analysis. The project involved data cleaning using Excel and crafting a detailed Power BI report to visualize insights gleaned from the data.

## Project Highlights:

- **Data Enhancement:** I augmented the initial dataset by incorporating external data, ensuring a more robust and complete foundation for analysis. This step was crucial in obtaining a holistic view of the entertainment landscape.

- **Excel Data Cleaning:** Leveraging the power of Excel, I meticulously cleaned and transformed the data, addressing inconsistencies, missing values, and other anomalies to prepare it for insightful analysis.

- **Power BI Report:** Developed an interactive and visually appealing Power BI report to showcase the findings. The report includes dynamic visualizations that highlight key metrics such as the best-performing actors, award distribution, and other relevant insights.

## Key Insights:

- **Best Performing Actor:** Uncover the identity of the actor who delivered standout performances, backed by quantitative metrics and visual evidence.

- **Award Distribution:** Explore a visual representation of award distributions, identifying individuals or entities that have received the most accolades.

- **Performance Trends:** Gain insights into performance trends over time, allowing for a historical perspective on the evolution of the entertainment industry.
